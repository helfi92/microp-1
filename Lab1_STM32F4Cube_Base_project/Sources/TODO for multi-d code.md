TODO
-----
- See if the code compiles and test it
- Take kalman filter out of main and into own Kalmanfilter_C.c
- Add error checks - check for proper dimesion match ups - there's something to specify it in the function so it will return if there is an error
- Minimize data used by make only 2 temp_m_x_m_data arrays for all of the temp matrices to point to
- Check why there is still an error at import
